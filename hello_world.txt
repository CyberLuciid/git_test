Adding some text for The Odin Project.
I don't quite understand much yet, but I know I will soon
and to be honest, that's good enough for me right now.
I just have to remember why I'm doing this.
I have to show myself that I'm capable of so much more than I sometimes tell myself.
More importantly, I absolutely have to give my children a better shot at life than I had.
The Odin Project is going to get me there.
I refuse to let my fears and doubts to stop me from achieving my goals.
One day soon, I will have earned everything I've been fighting for my entire life and all of the anxiety and tears will have been worth it.
